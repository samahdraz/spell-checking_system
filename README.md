# spell-checking_system
## I Developed a spell-checking system based on a binary search tree.
## I Implemented a suggestion system for non existing words.
## My program prompts the user to enter a sentence to check its spelling. For each word in the entered sentence, it checks whether the word exists in the binary search tree.
### (a) If the word exists, it will print that the word is correct.
### (b) If the word does not exist, it will print three suggestions for the correct word:
### - The word in the last node you reached before declaring that the word does not exist.
### - The word in the inorder predecessor of that leaf node.
### - The word in the inorder successor of that leaf node.
